## CodeReview
Project structure and name
Should provide proper name to the project
Two different package in contract (request & response) will be good practice.
"dname" instead of this parameter use meaningful name , like departmentName
## Annotations
Annotating your repository with @Repository is a good practice for clarity.
using @RequestMapping annotation is a good practice.
## Validations & Exception
both are missing
Test
-some test case is not working.
